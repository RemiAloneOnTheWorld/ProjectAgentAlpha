# ProjectAgentAlpha
Project Agent Alpha for the minor ACMGT.

## Description
"Agent-Alpha" is a local multiplayer, that takes place in a galaxy far away, where two enemy civilizations fight against each other.
Both established expandable space stations, which act as an important strategic hub. The civilizations' leaders can choose
on whether they want to play fast and aggressively or slow and safe by spending currency to expand in either manpower and their capabilities, such as speed, sight and other properties or space station expansions on each preparation phase. These expansions span from solar panels modules to acquire more currency, over barracks modules to create more space soldiers to interception modules. Furthermore, counter-strikes can be launched against the enemy by placing objects in the enemy's path, to block and slow down the soldiers. The soldiers are trained using a machine learning model to intelligently traverse the hazards of deep space to a center planet. Arriving at the center planet, attacks against the enemy can be launched against the enemy, with its possible severity depending on the amount of arrived agents.

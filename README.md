# ProjectAgentAlpha
Project Agent Alpha for the minor ACMGT.

## Description
"Agent-Alpha" is a local multiplayer, that takes place in a galaxy far away, where two enemy civilizations fight against each other.
Both established expandable space stations, which acts as an important strategic hub. The civilizations' leaders can choose
on whether they want to play fast and aggressively or slow and safe by spending currency to expand in either manpower and their capabilities, or space station expansions such as 
solar panels to acquire more currency, within each preparation phase.
Furthermore, counter-strikes can be launched against the enemy by placing objects in the enemy's path.
In the agent phase, both try to invade a center "planet" from where they can launch attacks against the enemy, with its possible severity depending on the amount of arrived agents.
